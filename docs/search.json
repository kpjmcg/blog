    "text": "Why “200 Views”?\nWhenever your taking pics for a photogrammetric model of an object, a good rule of thumb is 200 photos (sometimes called views); 30 photos per angle, with 6 angles. If you add about 20 pics to this for all of the tricky angles, then you’ve got a good view of the object and a good chance you’ll make a great model!\nThe trick is that each view has to be considered, taken with intention, and shown appropriate care. Making a good model is a conscious practice, a craft, and I hope to bring the same mentality to my blog."
