I am a current PhD candidate at the University of Sydney. I'm an archaeologist who currently studies Indigenous Australian grindstone production and quarrying. Through this I have gained knowledge in photogrammetry, tribology, python programming and data analysis. 


This blog contains various short articles on a variety of topics related to archaeology, photogrammetry, programming and maybe some finance and other things that interest me from time to time.
