I am a current PhD candidate at the University of Sydney. I'm an archaeologist who currently studies Indigenous Australian grindstone production and quarrying. Through this I have gained knowledge in photogrammetry, tribology, python programming and data analysis. 

This blog will contain various short articles on a variety of topics related to archaeology, photogrammetry, programming and maybe some finance and other things that interest me from time to time. 

## Education

University of Sydney | Sydney, NSW
PhD in Archaeology | Oct 2019 - 

University of Sydney | Sydney, NSW
B.A - Archaeology (Honours First Class) | 2013 - 2018
Thesis Title "Quantifying Lithic Reduction: A Reassessment
of the Scar Density Index"
  - I produced a replication of the Scar Density Index, using photogrammetry to record the sequential reduction of a set of
  ceramic cores. Based on theoretical and experimental results,
  I argue that the Scar Density Index does not work, and cannot work!

B.Sc - Geology and Geophysics | 2013 - 2017

## Projects

Rough | Python Package (Work in Progress)
Rough is a python package for the calculation of various surface roughness parameters from raster arrays. It is fully open source, documented and produced with NbDev. 

## Why "200 Views"?
Whenever your taking pics for a photogrammetric model of an object, a good rule of thumb is 200 photos (sometimes called views); 30 photos per angle, with 6 angles. If you add about 20 pics to this for all of the tricky angles, then you've got a good view of the object and a good chance you'll make a great model!

The trick is that each view has to be considered, taken with intention, and shown appropriate care. Making a good model is a conscious practice, a craft, and I hope to bring the same mentality to my blog.
